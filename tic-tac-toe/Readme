tic-tac-toe

4 X 4 chessboard
two types of chessman: X & O
X go first
win if 3-in-a-row

HOW?
1. method of exhaustion
perhaps OK because the amount is small.
test win by all Permutation of chess

AFTER 10 MINS THINKING...
... ...

2. something more funny
when making a move, change the status of its surrounding positions
every position can be seen as a object
win if an X's right is X and the second X's right is X

no need to define all eight positions, instead, we use RIGHT,DOWN,BOTTOM-RIGHT,UPPER-RIGHT.
